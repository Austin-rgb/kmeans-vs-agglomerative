# Comparing K-means Clustering with Agglomerative Clustering
These instructions assume you have Python installed on your system and that you have the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) installed. If any of these libraries are missing, you can install them using `pip install <library_name>` before running the programs.

## 1. K-Means Clustering:
   - The file for running K-means  clustering is saved as `k-means.py`.
   - Make sure you have the `online_shoppers_intention.csv` dataset in the same directory as the `k-means.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `kmeans_clustering.py` and the dataset.
   - Run the following command to execute the program:
     ```
     python k-means.py
     ```

## 2. Complete-Linkage Agglomerative Clustering:

   - The python code for Complete-Linkage Agglomerative clustering is saved in a file named `agglomerative.py`.
   - Make sure you have the `online_shoppers_intention.csv` dataset in the same directory as the `agglomerative.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `agglomerative_clustering.py` and the dataset.
   - Run the following command to execute the program:
     ```
     python agglomerative.py
     ```

## 3. Comparison of K-Means and Complete-Linkage AGNES:
   - The python code for comparing K-Means and Complete-Linkage AGNES has been saved in a file named `ri-comparison.py`.
   - Make sure you have the `online_shoppers_intention.csv` dataset in the same directory as the `ri-comparison.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `ri-comparison.py` and the dataset.
   - Run the following command to execute the program:
     ```
     python ri-comparison.py
     ```
